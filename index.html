                <p>
                    We provide a wide range of DevOps components, including Docker images, Terraform providers and CLI utilities.
                    The components are meant to ease the transition from traditional on-premise solutions to modern cloud solutions
                    powered by Infrastructure as Code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to bridge the gap between Application Developers and System Administrators, and thereby fully embrace
                    the DevOps concept. We want the Application Developers to be able to choose the best infrastructure for their
                    applications, without them having to understand how all of these complex solutions are configured. We know from
                    experience that abstraction layers are a good way to achieve this type of synergy, which is why we design our
                    solutions with that in mind.
