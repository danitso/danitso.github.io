                <p>
                    Danitso is a Danish company founded in 2013 by Dan Rudkjoebing Petersen after years of service
                    as an IT consultant in public institutions in Denmark.

                <p>
                    The motivation for this transition was the fact that most public institutions in Denmark are
                    experiencing some of the same problems with their IT infrastructure. However, most of them have
                    to deal with these problems on their own as there is only a limited amount of technical sparring
                    across the municipal and governmental borders. This results in many of the problems being solved
                    in more or less the same way, while also being accompanied by high fees every time. There simply
                    has to be a better way of doing this, and this is where Danitso joins the picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of solving the problems separately in each organization, Danitso focuses on solving them
                    in a generic and flexible way. We even do this under an Open Source licensing model to encourage
                    other organizations and individuals to contribute their work. We believe this is the best way to
                    tear down these inefficient borders and fully embrace the new possibilities.
